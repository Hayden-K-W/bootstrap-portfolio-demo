# bootstrap-portfolio-demo
This is for my coding temple class, and is a Bootstrap website designed by me. 

It includes basic JS for the Bootstrap components I use and a const with my prices for future use. Basic Bootstrap portfolio with fully responsive design. I aleady know some JavaScript and with the use of the official Bootstrap documentation, I was able to figure out how to get everything to function as expected. 

The modal popup gave me issues at first, but was able to resolve the issue.

This is a fairly basic Bootstrap portfolio, per the project scope, I did not want to over do it. Hope you enjoy!
